Welcome to **eLearn**, a modern, interactive learning platform built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a mini LMS (Learning Management System) that allows users to explore, watch, and track the progress of their online courses — all stored in their browser. It's like your personal Udemy-lite, but handcrafted with pure frontend skills.

---

## 🚀 Description of the Task

The primary goal of this project was to design a fully client-side application that demonstrates the fundamental workings of a course-tracking platform. Users can:

- Browse a list of courses (added through `localStorage`)
- Click and watch a course video
- Have their progress auto-tracked in real-time based on watch time
- Resume their learning later with updated progress
- Reset their learning history when needed

This project doesn't use any databases or server-side technologies. Instead, it harnesses the power of the browser's `localStorage` API to simulate persistent data, giving the illusion of a logged-in experience — no backend magic needed.

The interface is responsive, visually engaging, and built with usability in mind. Every click, hover, and scroll is crafted to offer a smooth user journey.

## 🛠️ Languages Used

This entire app is crafted using:

- **HTML5** – for creating the structural backbone of the platform
- **CSS3** – for styling, layout, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – for DOM manipulation, interactivity, course progress tracking, and localStorage management
- **Bootstrap 5** – for prebuilt responsive components and styling enhancements

No frameworks or build tools were used — just good old browser power 💪

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap CDN** – for navbar, offcanvas menu, buttons, and responsiveness
- **localStorage API** – to simulate persistent user data like progress tracking
- **YouTube iFrame Embedding** – for loading course videos into the player dynamically
- **Custom JS Logic** – to measure time watched, convert YouTube links, update progress bars
- **Media Queries** – for mobile responsiveness

---

## 🖥️ Editor Platform

This entire project was developed using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** — a lightweight, powerful, and feature-rich code editor. With support for live preview extensions, syntax highlighting, and fast editing, VS Code helped bring this project to life efficiently and comfortably.

## 🌍 Where This Can Be Applicable

This project can be extended or applied in several real-world contexts:

- 🏫 **College Projects**: As a frontend-based mini LMS to showcase web development skills
- 👨‍🏫 **Tutoring Portals**: To track progress on video-based content in a lightweight format
- 📊 **Product Demos**: For simulating learning experiences without backend setup
- 🧪 **Prototypes**: For startups wanting a proof-of-concept before investing in full-stack
- 🏡 **Personal Use**: To track your own video course consumption from platforms like YouTube

This setup is a perfect example of how much can be achieved with just frontend technologies when used creatively.

---

## 💡 How It Works (Quick Overview)

1. The user lands on the homepage with a welcoming message and a navbar.
2. Clicking **"My Learning"** leads to the learning dashboard, which fetches courses from localStorage.
3. Each course has a title, description, thumbnail, progress bar, and a video URL.
4. When a course is clicked, it opens an embedded YouTube player inside a modal.
5. A timer runs while the video is open, simulating watch time.
6. When the video is closed, the time is calculated and converted into a progress percentage.
7. The updated progress is saved back into localStorage and visually reflected in the progress bar.
8. The user can reset all data via the **Reset** button.

## 🎯 Final Words

This is more than just a project — it's a journey of learning by building. It shows how even without React, Node, or databases, we can still create full-blown interactive apps. This project is simple in stack, but rich in experience.

Stay curious. Keep building. And never stop learning — one click at a time.
